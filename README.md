# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Built a machine learning model using Random Forest Classifier with a preprocessing pipeline (scaling + encoding). The model achieved ~89% accuracy on test data with strong Precision, Recall, and F1 scores. It also supports real-time user input to predict heart disease risk (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease).
